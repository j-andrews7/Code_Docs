## Pipelines

> Because backups and revision history are good things. 

This repository contains all of the code and documentation needed for various pipelines I've run/developed/warped to my own needs. They are likely not perfect - some were hacked together in a matter of hours, others were repeatedly tweaked over the course of weeks or months. Regardless, the documentation for each should be comprehensive.  

**This serves as a record for myself and the lab. Though anyone is free to use them for their own needs, you do so at your own risk.** As anyone who works with big data know, consistency is key, and this fact guided the design of many of these pipelines - tools used, etc. Using the newest/best tools/methods is, of course, ideal, but reprocessing is a barrier and timesink that you should consider. 

**I am currently in the process of trying to simplify/streamline many of these.** For some of these, 4 separate people worked on them at various times throughout the years, and extra work is sometimes done trying to cobble the pieces together. I'm cutting out/combining steps whenever I get the chance so that there isn't so much data scrubbing and general formatting necessary.

These are usually fairly up to date, but there may be times where I alter something and don't change it here immediately. In addition, I often make slight tweaks/variations on these as I run through them that may or may not get mentioned/logged here.

Some of the scripts may be old/one-offs. Most scripts included in the actual pipelines should be fairly robust.
