## Pipelines
Because backups and revision history are good things. This repository contains all of the code and documentation needed for various pipeline's I've run/developed/warped to my own needs. They are likely not perfect - some were hacked together in a matter of hours, others were repeatedly tweaked over the course of weeks or months. Regardless, the documentation for each should be comprehensive.  

These are usually fairly up to date, but there may be times where I alter something and don't change it here immediately.
